# Dice-Composition
Simple app to create a composition matrix using various 6 note (hexatonic) scales. 

When the program is run, it will choose a random hexatonic scale from the list.

It will then choose 16 random notes from that scale and enter them into an array. This is the basis for the melody line.

It will then reformat this into a 4 x 4 matrix with the melody line reading from the bottom left to right, then the line above (left to right), etc.

If the matrix is read from bottom to top, the first column represents the chords (the bottom row being the lowest - bass - note of the chord)
